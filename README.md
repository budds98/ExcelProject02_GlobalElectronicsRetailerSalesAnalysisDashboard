# ExcelProject02_GlobalElectronicsRetailerSalesAnalysisDashboard
I created an interactive Excel dashboard with timeline slicers, displaying bar charts for brand sales (quantity and revenue), line charts for sales trends (2016-2021) and customer behavior (offline vs. online), plus a pie chart showing customer nationalities. This tool provides clear insights for strategic decisions.
